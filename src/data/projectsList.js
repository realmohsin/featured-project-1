        'From value engineering an entirely new HVAC system to modernizing various forms of vertical transport, this four-story flagship presented numerous challenges along with fun features that make it truly one-of-a-kind.',
        'Getting people, sneakers, and apparel quickly and efficiently through the space required four forms of lift. The project included entirely new escalators, dumbwaiters, and modernization of elevators and a vertical lifter. These systems created continuous plan revision that required a full partnership with the client and design team to overcome both cost and schedule impacts.',
        'The flagship experience comes from wall systems and display cases highlighting rare and limited edition sneakers, accented by lighting and media screens, and an AV package that includes a DJ booth for live music and events.'
